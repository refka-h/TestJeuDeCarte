# Test project

#springboot project

For building and running the application you need:

- [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17)
- [Maven 4](https://maven.apache.org)



## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.example.Test.TestApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
